 Description: This program solves na√Øve instances of the knapsack 
     problem.

     In a knapsack problem there is a set of objects. Each of them has a
     value and a weight. A knapsack problem is a problem of selecting a subset 
     of objects to maximize the total value of the selection, subject to the 
     restriction that the sum of weights must not exceed some upper value.

     In this file, the Constrained Quadratic Model sampler (CQM) is used.

 Disclaimer: This code is an experimental, not-optimized, not-tested code.
