 Description: This program solves na√Øve instances of the Hamiltonian cycle 
     problem using D-Wave's Quantum Annealer.

     A Hamiltonian cycle problem is a problem of visiting every node in a 
     graph, subject to the restriction that every node should be visited once
     and only once.

     When the graph is complete, the solution is easier than in the general
     case. 

     In this file, the QUBO formalism is used.

Disclaimer: This code is an experimental, not-optimized, not-tested code.
